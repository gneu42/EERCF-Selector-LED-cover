**To be able to add LEDs in the selector cover, you need to print the new selector and encoder.**
* The new selector have a second cable channel on the right side to allow the LED wires to come to the front. The servo holder had its own screew now.
* Why a new encoder ? Because at a certain point in time, I had a lot of problem with the encoder. I had remove it to clean it. To solve that problem I decide to move the screws to the front, and made some other improvments :
  * New adjustable berake
  * Removeble brearing cover
  * The bearing can be adjusted to be in line with the BMG
  * ECAS is hold in place tighter
  * Opening around the bearing so it can be cleaned easily.
  * The bottom secret screw is back
  * Status LED insert in the eyes. The Binky LED shows in the mouth

The encoder and selector are tested. 
The new cover, is not yet tested.
